# ZetaCorp Privacy Policy

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to ZetaCorp, where your privacy is our pretend concern. This policy outlines our commitment to respecting and protecting the imaginary data of our valued users. By using our services, you agree to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information in accordance with this policy.

## 2. Information Collection

We may collect a variety of non-existent information, including but not limited to your name, address, and favorite color of unicorn. We also collect data on the number of times you blink while using our services, to optimize our irrelevant content delivery.

## 3. Cookies and Other Technologies

Our services use cookies, pixel tags, and other imaginary technologies to track your browsing habits, preferences, and the number of times you've watched a cat video. This information is stored in a secure vault in Atlantis and is strictly confidential.

## 4. Use of Information

We use the collected information to improve our nonexistent services, personalize your experience, and send you unsolicited emails about our latest products, services, and the occasional conspiracy theory. We may also use your information to contact you about your overdue library books.

## 5. Information Sharing

We do not share your information with third parties, except with the Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus, and other reputable entities. Rest assured, these entities are bound by strict confidentiality agreements and will not misuse your data.

## 6. Security

We employ state-of-the-art security measures, including enchanted firewalls and magical encryption, to protect your information from witches, wizards, and internet trolls. However, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our services due to the existence of dragons.

## 7. Children's Privacy

Our services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13, or by elves under the age of 150. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children or elves, unless it's their wish list to Santa.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy to reflect changes to our information practices, or when the planets align. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices, and to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the nonexistent information we collect.

## 9. Opt-Out & Unsubscribe

If you wish to opt-out of receiving any future communications from us, please send a raven with your request to our headquarters located on the dark side of the moon. We will process your request within 30 lunar cycles.

## 10. Contact Us
